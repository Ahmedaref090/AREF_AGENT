# 🧬 AREF AGENT | AI-Powered Neural Link

**AREF AGENT** is a high-performance web application designed to transform static PDF documents into interactive, AI-generated competitive examinations. Built with a futuristic "Cyberpunk" aesthetic, it leverages advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide a gamified learning experience.

## 🌟 Project Overview
The core purpose of **AREF AGENT** is to bridge the gap between passive reading and active recall. By uploading any study material in PDF format, the agent scans the "neural pathways" of the text and generates a series of 10 challenging Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) to test the user's comprehension in real-time.

## 🚀 Core Functionalities
* **Intelligent PDF Analysis:** Automatically extracts and processes complex text data from uploaded documents.
* **Llama 3.3 Integration:** Powered by the Groq API for lightning-fast, highly accurate question generation.
* **Gamified Experience:** * **Neural Timer:** A 45-second countdown per node to simulate high-pressure environments.
    * **Visual Feedback:** Interactive UI that reacts to your answers (Glow for success, Shake for failure).
* **Real-Time Progress Tracking:** Sleek dashboard showing total nodes, remaining questions, live score, and a critical timer alert (last 10 seconds).
* **Detailed Correction:** Unlike standard apps, it displays the full text of the correct answer upon failure to ensure immediate learning.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy
The application features a dark, neon-infused interface inspired by sci-fi "hacking" consoles. Every element, from the glowing titles to the pulsating red timer, is crafted to keep the user engaged and focused on the mission: **Mastering the Data.**

## 🤖 Final Verdict System
At the end of each session, the agent evaluates the user's performance. Achieving a perfect score grants **"God Mode"** status, while any error triggers a humorous system reboot prompt: *"Agent Rank: F - Arga3 Basmag Tany ya Batal"* (Go back and study again, Hero!).
